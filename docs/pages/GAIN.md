## Graduate Applications International Network

The [Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)](https://gain-network.net) supports prospective graduate students from all countries across Africa applying for excellent programs (both Master and PhD) in economics and related fields (public policy, political science, etc.). African scholars are strongly under-represented in economics research globally. GAIN supports graduate applicants through information sharing, mentoring, peer-to-peer support, and reduction of financial barriers, with the goal of strengthening the pipeline for African students into the economics profession.

Applications for the next webinar phase will open in early 2023. Participation in the webinar phase is mandatory for subsequent application to the mentoring program.
