### Welcome to my website

I am a predoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich. Previously, I worked as a Junior Economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as part of the organization's Young Associates Programme (YAP). I hold an MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and a BSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

I will be starting a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University in the fall of 2023. My main areas of interest are in public and development economics. A central theme of my research interests is how market features interact with the collection of public revenues and the provision of public goods and services. I am especially interested in studying these links for taxation and social insurance.

### Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)

The [Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)](https://gain-network.net) supports prospective graduate students from all countries across Africa applying for excellent programs (both Master and PhD) in economics and related fields (public policy, political science, etc.). African scholars are strongly under-represented in economics research globally. GAIN supports graduate applicants through information sharing, mentoring, peer-to-peer support, and reduction of financial barriers, with the goal of strengthening the pipeline for African students into the economics profession.

Registration for the 2023-24 cycle is now closed. Sign up for a remind-me list to participate in the 2024-25 cycle [here](https://gain-network.net).
