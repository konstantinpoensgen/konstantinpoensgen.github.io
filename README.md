### Welcome to my website

I am a first year <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/phd-program" target="_blank">PhD student in Economics</a> at Harvard University. My main areas of interest are in public and development economics. A key theme of my research interests is how market features interact with the collection of public revenues and the provision of public goods and services. I am especially curious to study these links for taxation and social insurance.

Previously, I was a <a href="http://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/study/predoc.html" target="_blank">predoctoral fellow</a> at the University of Zurich and a Junior Economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development through the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/careers/young-associate-programme/" target="_blank">OECD Young Associates Programme (YAP)</a>.  I have been co-leading the mentoring program of the <a href="https://gain-network.net" target="_blank">Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)</a>. I hold a <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics" target="_blank">MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics</a> from the London School of Economics and a <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/academics/programs/bsc-economics/" target="_blank">BSc in Economics</a> from the University of Mannheim.
