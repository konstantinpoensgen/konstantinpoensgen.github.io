Welcome to my website. I am a predoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich. Previously, I worked as a Junior Economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as part of the organisation's Young Associates Programme. I hold a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a BSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

I am applying to Ph.D. programs in economics with admission in the fall of 2023. My main areas of interest are in public economics, especially in taxation and social insurance. A central theme of my research interests is how market features interact with the collection of public revenues and the provision of public goods and services.
