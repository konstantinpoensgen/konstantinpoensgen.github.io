### Welcome to my website

I am an incoming PhD student in Economics at Harvard University. My main areas of interest are in public and development economics. A central theme of my research interests is how market features interact with the collection of public revenues and the provision of public goods and services. I am especially interested in studying these links for taxation and social insurance.

I am co-leading the mentoring program of the <a href="https://gain-network.net" target="_blank">Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)</a>. GAIN supports prospective graduate students from all countries across Africa applying for excellent graduate programs in economics and related fields. Registration for the 2023 cycle is closed. If you are interested in participating in the GAIN program in 2024, sign up <a href="https://gain-network.net/participants" target="_blank">here</a>.

Previously, I was a predoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich and a Junior Economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development through the OECD Young Associates Programme (YAP). I hold a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and a BSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim.
