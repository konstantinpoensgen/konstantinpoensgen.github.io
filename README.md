### Welcome to my website

I am a predoctoral fellow at the University of Zurich. Previously, I worked as a Junior Economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as part of the organization's Young Associates Programme (YAP). I hold an MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and a BSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

I will be starting a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard University in the fall of 2023. My main areas of interest are in public and development economics. A central theme of my research interests is how market features interact with the collection of public revenues and the provision of public goods and services. I am especially interested in studying these links for taxation and social insurance.

You can find my [CV here]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/assets/phd_applications/cv_poensgen.pdf).

### Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)

Since the fall of 2021, I am co-leading the mentoring program of the [Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN)](https://gain-network.net). GAIN supports prospective graduate students from all countries across Africa applying for excellent programs (both Master and PhD) in economics and related fields (public policy, political science, etc.). African scholars are strongly under-represented in economics research globally. GAIN supports graduate applicants through information sharing, mentoring, peer-to-peer support, and reduction of financial barriers, with the goal of strengthening the pipeline for African students into the economics profession.

Registration for the 2023-24 cycle is now closed. Sign up for a remind-me list to participate in the 2024-25 cycle [here](https://gain-network.net). If you have any questions on the program or ideas to collaborate, please reach out.

### Advice for Ph.D. application 

There is lots of advice on PhD applications available online. Some of this advice includes: 
- [Notes on applying for a PhD - Jesse M. Shapiro](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapiro/files/phdnotes.pdf)
- AEA on [preparing for graduate school](https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/grad-prep) and [suggested timeline](https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/students/grad-prep/timeline)
- [FAQs on PhD applications - Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com/blog/2022/03/25/faqs-on-phd-applications/)
- [Guide for students considering a PhD - Dick Startz](https://econ.ucsb.edu/~startz/A%20Guide%20for%20UCSB%20Undergraduates%20Considering%20a%20PhD%20in%20Economics.pdf)
- [How to get into an Economics PhD program - Aparna Soni](http://www.aparnagsoni.com/for-prospective-phds-blog/2018/1/11/getting-into-an-econ-phd-program-recommended-reading)
- [Advice for applying to grad school in Economics - Susan Athey](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/professional-advice/)

I am planning to write up some advice based on my experience in the PhD application process and as a team lead for [GAIN](https://gain-network.net) in the future. For now, I am sharing the documents I have used for my applications, hoping they give prospective applicants a sense of _possiple_ ways to create and structure these materials.
