#### Sample application materials

To provide an example of application materials, the following documents are the ones I had submitted in my application to PhD programs in economics (12/2022). Please keep several things in mind: 
- my application materials are not necessarily "good"
- they only represent one possible content/structure
- everyone's application profile is unique 

Keeping those disclaimers in mind, these were my application materials:
- [CV]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/cv_poensgen.pdf)
- [Statement of Purpose (SOP)]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/poensgen_sop_harvard_econ.pdf)
- [Writing sample]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/poensgen_writingsample.pdf)
- [Diversity statement]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/Poensgen_DiversityStatement_GAIN.pdf)
- Research proposals on [local taxation]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/poensgen_markettaxation_proposal.pdf), [health insurance]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/poensgen_MPHI_proposal.pdf), and [innovation productivity]({{ konstantinpoensgen.github.io }}/docs/phd_applications/poensgen_rdduplication_proposal.pdf)

#### Scholarships

Applying to scholarships (or external funding) is particularly important if you are applying to Master's programs. PhD programs tend to be funded, but it can still be useful to secure external funding in either the application stage or later funding/teaching situation. It is critical to search for scholarships early on in the application process -- waiting for after the grad school applications is often too late.
